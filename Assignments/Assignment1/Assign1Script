# Sample Slurm job script
#   for TACC Lonestar6 AMD Milan nodes
#
#   *** OpenMP Job in Normal Queue ***
# 
# Last revised: October 22, 2021
#
# Notes:
#
#   -- Launch this script by executing
#   -- Copy/edit this script as desired.  Launch by executing
#      "sbatch milan.openmp.slurm" on a Lonestar6 login node.
#
#   -- OpenMP codes run on a single node (upper case N = 1).
#        OpenMP ignores the value of lower case n,
#        but slurm needs a plausible value to schedule the job.
#
#   -- Default value of OMP_NUM_THREADS is 1; be sure to change it!
#
#   -- Increase thread count gradually while looking for optimal setting.
#        If there is sufficient memory available, the optimal setting
#        is often 56 (1 thread per core) but may be higher.
